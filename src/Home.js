        Kenya is home to the majority of our projects. Specifically, we mainly
        work in the slum of Kibera (one of the world's largest) in Nairobi. Here
        we help bring education, health, safety, work, and hope through our
        projects: the New Hope Academy, the Kibera Penda Project, and Project
        Biashara. Learn more about each of these projects and how you can get
        involved by clicking the links below.
